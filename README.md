# ccdred_sb
**Ccdred_sb** is a package of utilities for reducing astronomical images modeled after the IRAF's `imred.ccdred` package. The package modules aren't as sophisticated as the the Astropy affiliated package [**ccdproc**](https://ccdproc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html), but this package doesn't require an extensive understanding of other [Astropy](https://www.astropy.org) modules.
